# webgl-react-boilerplate
Base code and utilities for a basic WebGL scene with minimal control 

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Edit engine.ts for bulk of code, and then shaders for frag and vertex shaders.

Current example provides framework for stencils, image textures, render target textures, and more.

3D context can be added simply by adding third value to vertices and normals and adjusting the attribute handling with this.
